# Web Authentication with Google OAuth and WebAuthn

This project was developed as part of the Software Security Engineering class, demonstrating the implementation of secure authentication mechanisms using Google OAuth and Web Authentication (WebAuthn). The application showcases a modern approach to authentication, combining Google's OAuth service with WebAuthn for passwordless, hardware-backed authentication.

## Features
- **Google OAuth Integration**: Allows users to sign in using their Google account, providing a familiar and secure login process.
- **Web Authentication (WebAuthn)**: Supports passwordless authentication using devices that comply with the WebAuthn standard, such as biometric sensors, USB security keys, or built-in authenticators.
- **Enhanced Security**: Combines the convenience of Google sign-in with the advanced security of WebAuthn, protecting users against phishing and other attacks.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used to create the server and handle routing.
- **Passport.js**: Middleware for authentication in Node.js, used to integrate Google OAuth.
- **WebAuthn API**: Standardized API for web authentication, enabling strong, passwordless authentication.
